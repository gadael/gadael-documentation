The adjustment history may also include automatic monthly balance additions for rights that must accrue as the days are worked.

Automatic decreases in pay may occur and will be visible on this page, eg decreases in RTT based on sick leave.

## The list of requests

Applications are ordered by the creation date, the most recent requests appear first. Several types of requests may appear in this list:

* Absences
* Deposits on the time savings account
* Recovery requests

Among the absences displayed, there may be leave requests created by you, imposed absences created by managers on a set of people or absences created by managers only on your account (this type of absence can be handled by an approval).

## Create a leave request

A leave request is created in two steps.

1. The definition of the period of absence
2. The distribution of the duration on the leave rights available

### Definition of period of absence

First step, assisted by a planning view:

![First step of the leave request](images/account-absence-create.png)

On the first step, the period is selected on a schedule containing the periods worked, the absences already declared, and the holidays. The frieze below allows a comparison with the school holidays.


### Distribution of duration on leave rights

In the second step, the displayed table contains all the rights that can be used for the requested period. It is possible to a right to be displayed with several renewal periods, in this case it is advisable to consume the oldest balance because it will be brought to disappear sooner.

If a right is displayed with a less than zero balance, negative balances are allowed, this can be the case for leave without pay for example.
